# MetaSite Demo

\Has **absolutely zilch** affiliation with Meta or the """""_Metaverse_"""""

MetaSite is a site that tries to be meta. Not too meta though â€“ just a little bit.

_In progress_

- Writing stupid stuff
- Refactoring transition animation and layout of pages
- Corresponding minimap of site pages

Some ideas explored include:

- websites (duh)
- media
- nothing else, this is a demo.
