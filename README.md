# MetaSite Demo

This is an experimental branch.

Has no affiliation with Meta.

MetaSite is a site that tries to be meta. Not too meta though â€“ just a little bit.

Essentially, this is an experimental website using basic pages and text, but organised in a spatial manner, as if regressing somewhat to a physical organisation of pieces of paper. Navigation is currently mainly provided by arrows displayed on the sides of pages.

Contact L3#4623 on Discord if interested in the project, working on something similar, working on something dissimilar, or not working on anything.

### Purpose of the Demo

"I personally refuse anyway, to be confined so far, in the landscape of concept elaboration via boringly linear-scrolling blog posts, cobbled together with other mixed media forms with little rhyme or craft, or to be led to the difficulties of larger video game development. I am afraid I also must include in my attack, traditional books and most literature in human history; for they too, fall into the realm of rather linearly-interactive conceptual explorations."

I've been experimenting with using a more spatial-visual approach to writing and teasing out concepts and ideas in order to have a more effective way to grapple with the plurality of all human concepts and areas of interest to be studied.

Writing is not to be downplayed - after all, it has propped up and allowed so much of humanity to flourish as it has and will. I'm a fan. I merely seek to push at the limits of media.

Thus the purpose of this particular demo is to evoke in the consciousness of those who are entangled in the labyrinth of traditional literature and writing, a sense that other utilities are always available to be experimented with. For I am unsure that this particular spatial form is of necessarily a utilitarian interest. Nevertheless, I feel that I am rather in the building rapids of a river that will only continue producing more of this particular medium at least in my own lifetime.

If I end up producing an incomparably extensive body of work in this medium, I am sure that that will be a fair experiment to point at the medium's utility and effect on one's outlook in their existence.

Possible empirical experiment for effects of experiencing spatial work:
for variety of Y people, surround them with informational work translated to a graphic-spatial format for X time (long-term); conduct qualitative interviews and note psychological and neurological activity/effects.

### Purpose of Sharing the Demo

This section will determine whether I should seek to share this work or not.

If I am correct in my assumption that humanity may have strong benefits over disadvantages to adopting a wider use of such a medium, it is pertinent to share the initial prototypes, so that others may build on and evolve the medium as they see fit, improve the underlying plumbing and perform either an explicit or non-explicit experiment on the effects of using the medium, whether creating or experiencing.

If I am rather incorrect that humanity has a good series of use cases for the medium, I will be disappointed and elated - such is the nature of any experimentation, whether arts, engineering or science. I'd probably be shamed, burned and killed if this were a wide-scale social 'experiment' though - luckily this is not such the case, at least for the time being.

Yeah, for the most part I'm just kidding myself writing this attempt at justification. I already know what I need to do that is in my power.

Other Notes:
At the moment, the biggest examples of other technologies that make visual thinking more available are: Canva, Figma, Miro possibly. My own bias.
